#The story for this code is a Diamond Store

    #TODO 1
    #Welcome the user to your Diamond Store by PRINTING "Welcome to my Diamond Store!" (without the quotations)
    #It's recommended that you copy/paste the phrase inside the quotations to prevent typos

    #You need to calculate the price of a diamond for the diamond store
    #per_carat is the price per carat and weight is the weight of the diamond in carats
